# Directions-Reduction

Write a function dirReduc which will take an array of strings and returns an array of strings with the needless 
directions removed (W<->E or S<->N side by side).

The Haskell version takes a list of directions with data Direction = North | East | West | South.
The Clojure version returns nil when the path is reduced to nothing.
The Rust version takes a slice of enum Direction {NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, WEST}.
